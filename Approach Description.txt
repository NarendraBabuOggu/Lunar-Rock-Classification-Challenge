For this problem i used the simple approach. 
	First i loaded the data (images, labels) into program meory.
	After that i reduced the image size using the resize funtion from opencv and converted the labels into categories. 
	I used the train_test_split function to split the data into train and validation sets. 
	Later, I used the Resnet50(pre-trained) model to train the images. 
	Also, i have provided the code to save and load the model.
